# Docker Exercises
This is intended to help learn aspects of Docker by presenting a number of challenges.
The challenges will address areas such as Docker, docker-compose, networking, logging, debugging and general approaches to trouble shooting.

Each exercise will consist of various files (Docker, source and shell scripts) that may contain one or more problems and a goal on what they should be doing.
It will be up to you to find and correct the issue(s).

Each exercise should include a description of what it is supposed to do and how to run it which may not be entirely correct or complete but acts a starting point.

The Answer directory in each exercise should contain a working solution to the problem.

Note that there is likely more than one solution to any problem and you may come up with a better "fix" or additional exercises to add.
If you do, sends us a PR and we will add it.

These are in no particular order so you can cherry pick whatever you would like to try out.

New exercises should be added off and on so check back to continue your skills improvement.
